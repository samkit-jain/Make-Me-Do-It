# Make-Me-Do-It

The purpose of this app is to keep on reminding the user to perform the task he has chosen every 15 minutes until he does it. The user also selects the time (no date can be chosen) at which he's supposed to do the required task. The app then starts reminding from that time and every 15 minutes thereafter.

The reminders stop once the user honestly answers if he has done the required task.

Even though there is no way to judge for honesty from an app, the app can be useful to complete tasks if answered honestly.

To be more precise, purpose is to irritate you until you finally give up and JUST DO IT!!!

Feedback Welcome :)

NOTE: Reminder would be removed if the device is rebooted or turned off.
